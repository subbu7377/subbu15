    <p>The World Wide Web (WWW or simply the Web) is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system">information system</a> that enables <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_(communication)">content</a> sharing over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a> through user-friendly ways meant to appeal to users beyond <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology">IT</a> specialists and hobbyists.[1] It allows documents and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_resource">web resources</a> to be accessed over the Internet according to specific rules of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">HyperText Transfer Protocol </a> (HTTP).[2]</p>
    <p>The Web was invented by English computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> while at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a> in 1989 and opened to the public in 1991. It was conceived as a "universal linked information system".[3][4] Documents and other media content are made available to the network through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">web servers</a> and can be accessed by programs such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browsers.</a> Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through character strings called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL">uniform resource locators (URLs).</a>
        <p>The original and still very common document type is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page">web page</a> formatted in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).</a> This markup language supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text">plain text,</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image">images,</a> embedded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video">video</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal">audio</a> contents, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">scripts</a> (short programs) that implement complex user interaction. The HTML language also supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">hyperlinks</a> (embedded URLs) which provide immediate access to other web resources. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_navigation">Web navigation, </a>or web surfing, is the common practice of following such hyperlinks across multiple websites. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application">Web applications</a> are web pages that function as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software">application software.</a> The information in the Web is transferred across the Internet using HTTP. Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name">domain name</a> make up a website. A single web server may provide multiple websites, while some websites, especially the most popular ones, may be provided by multiple servers. Website content is provided by a myriad of companies, organizations, government agencies, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content">individual users;</a> and comprises an enormous amount of educational, entertainment, commercial, and government information.</p>
